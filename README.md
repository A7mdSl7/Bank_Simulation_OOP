# Bank Simulation (OOP Version)

This project is an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** version of a simple bank simulation system. It allows users to create a bank account, deposit and withdraw money, and check their balance ‚Äî all using classes and object-oriented design principles in Python.

## üìå Project Overview

This version builds upon a previous functional approach and restructures the program using a class-based model to enhance modularity, scalability, and readability.

### üîß Features

- Create a new account with a user name and starting balance.
- Deposit money into the account.
- Withdraw money if sufficient balance exists.
- View current account balance.
- Structured with proper encapsulation and class methods.

## üß± Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (for implementation and testing)

## üß† Concepts Applied

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Class & Object
  - Encapsulation
  - Instance Methods
- Input/Output Operations
- Basic Conditionals and Loops

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open the `Bank_Simulation_OOP.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in order.
3. Follow the instructions in the cell output to interact with the simulation.

## üí° Example

```python
account1 = Account("Ahmed", 1000)
account1.deposit()
account1.withdraw()
account1.check_balance()
```
